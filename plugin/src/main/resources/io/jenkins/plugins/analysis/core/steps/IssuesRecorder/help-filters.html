    The created report of issues can be filtered afterwards. You can specify an arbitrary number of include or exclude
    filters. Currently, there is support for filtering issues by module name, package or namespace name, file name,
    category or type. Include filters will be combined with <code>or</code>, exclude filters with <code>and</code>.
    If no filter is defined, then all issues will be published. Filters with empty regular expression will be ignored.
